:tada: PRs adding new issues are very much welcome!

To make things easier for everyone, follow these simple steps:

- If there isn't an issue on nightwatch that reproduces your bug, please create one.
- Duplicate the `tests/.template` directory, and rename it with the issue number.
- Customize the files in that new directory to reproduce your issue.
- Add a new row in the `README.md` file.
- Add a new row in the `package.json` test scripts.
